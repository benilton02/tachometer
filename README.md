## Tachometer

> Develop a prototype of a Tachometer using Arduino and its accessories. According to the necessary requirements.

## Requirements

> 1. It must contain a 12V DC Motor with speed in rpm with or without gearbox;
>
> 2. It must have a system that establishes at what speed the 12V motor is rotating and in which direction. The project must contain at least 02 different control speeds. It is up to the Team to use any detection system;
>
> 3. It must contain an LCD, or similar, to indicate the speed value in rpm (revolution per minutes) and the direction of rotation;
>
> 4. The project must include a button or pushbutton, or similar, which, once activated, makes the 12V DC motor stop and rotate in the opposite direction that it was rotating and has an audible alarm to indicate this change;
>
> 5. It must have a protection system so that the operator does not put his hand on the engine while it is running, which can be any system that uses one or several sensors already studied, that is, photoelectric or ultrasonic, among others;
>
> 6. It must be easy to move and install, that is, small, light, portable and DC powered without an AC outlet, except for the 12V DC motor power supply;
>
> 7. It must have a structure of plastic, wood or any other type of material.
